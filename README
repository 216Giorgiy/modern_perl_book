What is Modern Perl?
--------------------

Perl is a popular, powerful, and widely used programming language.  Over its
twenty year lifespan, it's powered millions of systems worldwide, moving
trillions of dollars.  More importantly, it's helped countless people get their
work done effectively.

The Perl community has a reputation for clever solutions -- and a reputation
for institutional knowledge that isn't always clear to novices and neophytes.
Modern Perl, written with this knowledge, can be very clean, very maintainable,
and even more powerful than you imagine.

That knowledge should be available to everyone.  This book will teach you how
to program Perl, but it will also teach you how to *think* about Perl, so that
you can use it to your full advantage.
