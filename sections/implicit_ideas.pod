=head3 Implicit Ideas

Z<implicit_ideas>

Like many spoken languages, Perl provides shortcuts to use where conciseness is
appropriate.  One such implicit idea is the notion of L<context>, where both
the compiler and a programmer reading the code can understand the expected
number of results or the type of an operation from existing information without
adding explicit additional information to disambiguate.

The best example of such features is the default variable, C<$_>.  It's most
notable in its I<absence>: many of Perl's built in operations perform their
work on the contents of C<$_> in the absence of an explicit other variable.
You can still use C<$_> as the variable, but it's unnecessary.

For example, the C<chomp> operator removes any trailing newline sequence from
the given string:

    my $uncle = "Bob\n";
    say "'$uncle'";
    chomp $uncle;
    say "'$uncle'";

Without an explicit variable, C<chomp> removes the trailing newline sequence from C<$_>.  Thus, these two lines of code are equivalent:
