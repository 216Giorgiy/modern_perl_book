package design
    - API design
    - parsimony of symbols/exports
    - re-entrancy/thread safety
    - global concerns

why reuse the CPAN infrastructure?
    - good tools
    - automation
    - reporting
    - dependency tracking
    - consistent installation paths

local CPAN repository?
    - too advanced?  Nice to discuss, if there's space
