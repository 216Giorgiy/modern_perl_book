=for author

explanation
    - treating one data type as another

booleanification
    - what's boolean true and false?

stringification
    - default approach

numification
    - what looks like a number
    - Scalar::Util::looks_like_number()

referenceification
    - need a better description
    - disallowed by strict 'refs'

possible:
    - globs and their slots
    - though that's pretty advanced

caching
    - SV behavior

DualVars (?)

recognizing operator type contexts
    - stringy ops
    - numeric ops
    - boolean operations
    - perlop (logical, stringwise, numeric)
