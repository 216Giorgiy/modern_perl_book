start with Test::More
    - Test::Simple is too simple now

basic assertions
    - ok or not okay
    - as many of these as possible
    - small granularity

running tests
    - prove
    - Test::Harness

comparisions:
    - is
    - isa/can
    - is_deeply()
        - maybe look to something else for this

test organization
    - .t files
    - group by usage
    - test granularity suggestions
    - plan management
    - idempotency

pluggable test modules
    - Test::Exception
    - Test::Database (forgot the exact name)
    - ... what else?

further organization
    - refer to Test::Class series on MPB
