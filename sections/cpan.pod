=head2 The CPAN

Explaining the CPAN
Explaining how to use it?

Where do I cover features of Perl that make it useful without explaining them?

Modularity:
    - packages
    - modules
    - objects

Community standards:
    - installability
    - testing
    - documentation standards
    - CPAN accoutrements:
        - CPAN testers
        - RT accounts
        - ratings
        - history and documentation
    - dependencies
    - rough standards on licensing

Usability:
    - nearly configuration-free running
    - CPAN client included in core
    - strong core culture of use and recommendation

Broad applicability:
    - 7258 uploaders/66400 modules/17268 distributions
