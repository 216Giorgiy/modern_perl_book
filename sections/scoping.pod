=head3 Scope

Z<scoping>

lexical scope
    - my
    - most important scoping
    - not in symbol table; resolved at compile time
    - allows closures (whether you intend them or not)

dynamic scope
    - local/our
    - relies on global variables
    - visible from outside namespace/lexical scope
    - our subtly broken

state scoping
    - state
    - lexical scoping but retains value after initialized
    - interaction with closures?

implicit lexicalization
    - my $_
    - what is the scope of C< for my $i ( ... ) >?
    - which constructs localize $_ and which do not?

necessary localization
    - $/, $", other globals
    - $!, $@
    - sometimes $_
    - an exception: $| (? - I think so)
