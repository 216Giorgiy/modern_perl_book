Z<exceptions>

=for author

explaining exceptions
    - alternate control flow
    - propagates outward through calling scope (dynamic scope)
    - not resumable
    - signals an exceptional condition that needs special handling

eval BLOCK
    - introduces a new scope
    - handles all exceptions caught in that dynamic scope

built-in exceptions
    - emulate with autodie
    - mostly (runtime) syntax errors
    - sometimes indicate bad or unexpected data
        - method call on non-invocant

die
    - you've seen this with open(...) or die...
    - die STRING
    - die OBJECT

$@
    - gotcha: scope cleanup may unset $@
    - localize

Try::Tiny
    - improved correctness
    - slightly better syntax
    - improved correctness

Exception::Class
    - a hierarchy of exceptions
    - easy to combine with Try::Tiny
    - smart match for selection
    - more information; better options
    - sadly underused
