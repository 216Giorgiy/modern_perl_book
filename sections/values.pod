=head3 Values

Z<values>

X<variables>
X<variables>

Computer programs contain I<variables>: containers which hold I<values>.
Values are the actual data the programs manipulate.  While it's easy to explain
what that data might be -- your aunt's name and address, the distance between
your office and a golf course on the moon, or the weight of all cookies you've
eaten this year -- the rules regarding that data are often strict.  Writing an
effective program often means understanding the best (or simplest or fastest or
most compact or easiest) way of representing that data for the particular
manipulations your program must perform on that data.

Thus effective Perl programs depend on the accurate representation and
manipulation of values.

While the structure of a program depends heavily on the means by which you
model your data with appropriate variables, these variables would be
meaningless if they couldn't accurately contain the data itself -- the values.

=head4 Strings

X<strings>

One primary value in Perl 5 is the I<string>.  A string is a piece of data with
no particular formatting, no particular contents, and no semantic meaning
beyond the fact that it's a string.  It could be your name.  It could be the
contents of an image file read from your hard drive.  It could be the Perl
program itself.

A string has no meaning to the program until you give it meaning.  The
emboldened lines in this example are strings:

=begin programlisting

    my $name    = B<'Donner Odinson, Bringer of Despair'>;
    my $address = B<"Room 539, Bilskirnir, Valhalla">;

=end programlisting

A string is a fixed amount of data delineated by some quoting form.  This
example shows single quotes and double quotes.

X<strings; single-quoted>

Characters in a I<single-quoted string> represent themselves literally, with
one exception.  You may embed a single quote inside a single-quoted string by escaping the quote with a leading backlash:

=begin programlisting

    my $reminder = 'DonB<\'>t forget to escape the single quote!';

=end programlisting

X<strings; double-quoted>

A I<double-quoted string> has more complex (and often, more useful) behavior.
You may escape control and non-printable characters in the string.

=begin programlisting

    my $newline  = "B<\n>";
    my $tab      = "B<\t>";
    my $carriage = "B<\r>";

=end programlisting

=begin sidebar

You may also embed the characters themselves directly into the string -- a
string declaration may cross lines and run as long as you want, but it's often
more maintainable to use the escapes.  Whitespace can be difficult to read
precisely in a text editor.

=end sidebar

=for author

Should I include a table of escapes here?  It's the same as in regexes.

=end for

X<interpolation>
X<strings; interpolation>

You may also I<interpolate> the value of a scalar variable or the values of an
array within a double-quoted string directly:

=begin programlisting

    my $factoid = "Did you know that B<$name> lives at B<$address>?";

=end programlisting

You may include a literal double-quote inside a double-quoted string by
escaping it with a leading backslash:

=begin programlisting

    my $quote = "\"Ouch,\", he cried.  \"That I<hurt>!\"";

=end programlisting

X<quoting operators>
X<q>
X<operators; q>
X<qq>
X<operators; qq>

If you find that hideously ugly, you may use an alternate I<quoting operator>.
The C<q> operator performs single quoting, while the C<qq> operator performs
double quoting.  In each case, you may choose your own delimiter for the
string.  The character immediately following the operator determines the
beginning and end of the string.  If the character is the opening character of
a balanced pair, the closing character will be the final delimiter.  Otherwise,
the character itself will be both the starting and ending delimiter.

=begin programlisting

    my $quote    = B<qq{>"Ouch", he said.  "That I<hurt>!"B<}>;
    my $reminder = B<q|>Don't forget to escape the single quote!B<|>;

=end programlisting

X<heredocs>
X<strings; heredocs>

Even though you can declare a complex string with a series of embedded escape
characters, sometime's it's easier to declare a multi-line string on multiple
lines.  The I<heredoc> syntax lets you assign one or more lines of a string
with a different syntax:

=begin programlisting

    my $blurb =<<'END_BLURB';

    He looked up.  "Time is never on our side, my child.  Do you see the irony?
    All they know is change.  Change is the constant on which they all can
    agree.  Whereas we, born out of time to remain perfect and perfectly
    self-aware, can only suffer change if we pursue it.  It is against our
    nature.  We rebel against that change.  Shall we consider them greater
    for it?"
    END_BLURB

=end programlisting

The C<< <<'END_BLURB' >> syntax has three several parts.  The double
angle-brackets introduce the heredoc.  The quotes are optional and determine
whether the heredoc obeys single-quoted or double-quoted behavior with regard
to variable and escape character interpolation.  The C<END_BLURB> itself is an
arbitrary identifier which the Perl 5 parser uses as the ending delimiter.

Be careful; regardless of the indentation of the heredoc declaration, the
ending delimiter must begin in the first column of the program.

=begin sidebar

If the identifier begins with spaces, those spaces must be present exactly in
the ending delimiter.

=end sidebar

=head4 Unicode and Strings

X<unicode>

Unicode is a system for representing characters in the world's written
languages.  While most English text uses only 127 characters (and thus requires
seven bits of storage, which fits nicely into eight-bit bytes), it's
naE<iuml>ve to believe that you won't someday need an umlaut, for example.

Perl 5 handles Unicode internally, and mostly you can ignore that it does so.
Because there are several representations for I<how> to store Unicode, you have
to know what kind of data you receive from the external world and what kind of
data you want to emit to the external world, but inside Perl, all of the string
operations you expect work just fine on Unicode data as opposed to ASCII
dataN<Provided you don't assume that a character in a string requires a byte of
storage.>.

For more details on what Unicode is, why encodings matter, and how to manage
incoming and outgoing data in a Unicode world, see C<perldoc perluniintro>.

X<pragmas; utf8>
X<utf8>
X<encoding>

You may include Unicode characters in your programs in three ways.  The easiest
is to use the C<utf8> pragma (L<pragmas>), which tells the Perl parser to read
the rest of the source code file in the UTF-8 I<encoding> (an arrangement and
representation of Unicode characters).  This allows you to use Unicode
characters in strings as well in identifiers:

=begin programlisting

    use utf8;

    my $cost = '1000£';

    sub ¥ { ... }

=end programlisting

You will need to use a text editor which understands the UTF-8 encoding, and
you will need to save your file appropriately.

X<escapes; \x{}>
X<\x{}>

You may also use the Unicode escape sequence to represent character encodings.
The syntax C<\x{}> represents a single character; place the hex form of the
character's Unicode number within the curly brackets.

=begin sidebar

Note that these escapes interpolate only within double-quoted strings.

=end sidebar

X<charnames pragma>
X<pragmas; charnames>
X<escapes; \N{}>
X<\N{}>

Some Unicode characters have names.  Though these are more verbose, they can be
clearer to read than Unicode numbers.  You must use the C<charnames> pragma to
enable them.  Use the C<\N{}> escape to refer to them:

=begin programlisting

    use charnames ':full';
    use Test::More tests => 1;

    my $escaped_thorn = "\x{00FE}";
    my $named_thorn   = "\N{LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN}";

    is( $escaped_thorn, $named_thorn, 'Thorn equivalence check' );

=end programlisting

You may use the C<\x{}> and C<\N{}> forms within regular expressions as well as
anywhere else you may legitimately use a string or a character.

=head4 Numbers

X<numbers>
X<integers>
X<floating-point values>

Perl also supports numbers, whether integers or floating-point values.  They
support scientific notation as well as binary, octal, and hexadecimal
representations:

=begin programlisting

    my $integer   = 42;
    my $float     = 0.007;
    my $sci_float = 1.02e14;
    my $binary    = B<0b>101010;
    my $octal     = B<0>52;
    my $hex       = B<0x>20;

=end programlisting

The emboldened characters are the numeric prefixes for binary, octal, and hex
notation respectively.  Be aware that the leading zero always indicates octal
mode; this can occasionally produce unanticipated confusion.

X<numbers; underscore separator>
X<underscore>

For dealing with large numbers, you may use the underscore character (C<_>) to
separate thousands.  Compare the readability advantage:

=begin programlisting

    my $us_billion = 1000000000;
    my $us_billion = 1B<_>000B<_>000B<_>000;

=end programlisting

=begin sidebar

Even though you can represent floating-point values explicitly in Perl 5 with
perfect accuracy, Perl 5 stores them internally in a binary format.  Comparing
floating-point values is sometimes imprecise in specific ways; consult
C<perldoc perlnumber> for more details.

=end sidebar

You may not use commas to separate thousands in numeric literals; the parser
will interpret the commas as comma operators.  You I<can> use underscores in
other places within the number, however.  The parser will treat them as
invisible characters.  Your readers may not.  These are equivalent:

=begin programlisting

    my $billion = 1000000000;
    my $billion = 1_000_000_000;
    my $billion = 10_0_00_00_0_0_0;

=end programlisting

Consider the most readable alternative, however.

X<Scalar::Util>
X<looks_like_number>
X<Scalar::Util; looks_like_number>

Occasionally it's useful to determine whether Perl 5 will consider something
that looks like a number as a number.  The core module C<Scalar::Util> contains
a function named C<looks_like_number> which returns true Perl will consider the
given argument numeric.

X<Regexp::Common>

The C<Regexp::Common> module from the CPAN provides several well-tested regular
expressions to determine the I<type> (whole number, integer, floating-point
value) of a numeric value.

=head4 Undef

X<undef>

Perl 5 has a value which represents an unassigned/undefined/unknown value:
C<undef>.  Declared but undefined scalar variables contain C<undef>:

=begin programlisting

    my $name = undef;   # unnecessary assignment
    my $rank;           # also contains undef

=end programlisting

C<undef> evaluates to false in boolean context.  Be aware that an array
containing a single element which is itself C<undef> evaluates to true in a
boolean context.  Interpolating C<undef> into a string -- or evaluating it in a
string context -- produces an C<uninitialized value> warning, if you have
C<warnings> enabled.

=head4 The Empty List

X<empty list>
X<()>

When used on the right-hand side of an assignment, the C<()> construct
represents an empty list.  When evaluated in scalar context, this evaluates to
C<undef>.  In list context, it represents an empty list.

When used on the left-hand side of an assignment, it enforces list context.  To
count the number of elements returned from an expression in list context
without using a temporary variable, you use the idiom (L<idioms>):

=begin programlisting

    my $count = B<()> = get_all_clown_hats();

=end programlisting

Because of the right associativity (L<associativity>) of the assignment
operator, Perl calls C<get_all_clown_hats()> in list context.  This produces a
list.  Even though that list never gets assigned to anything, that list is the
return value of that subexpression.  The assignment of that return value is in
scalar context because C<$count> is a scalar,

You don't have to understand all of the implications of this code right now,
but it does demonstrate how a few of Perl's fundamental design features can
combine to produce interesting and useful behavior.

=head4 Lists

X<lists>

Lists and arrays are not interchangeable in Perl.  You may store a list in an
array and you may coerce an array to a list with the appropriate context, but
they are separate entities.  Lists may occur verbatim in source code as values:

=begin programlisting

    my @first_fibs = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21);

=end programlisting

=for author

Explain lvalue?  Link from here?

=end for

... as lvalue targets of assignments:

=begin programlisting

    my ($package, $filename, $line) = caller();

=end programlisting

... or as lists of expressions:

=begin programlisting

    say name(), ' => ', age();

=end programlisting

Note that you do not need parentheses to I<create> lists; where present, the
parentheses in these examples group expressions to change I<precedence> of
those expressions (L<precedence>).

X<operators; range>
X<operators; ..>
X<..>
X<range operator>

You may use the range operator to create lists of literals in a compact form:

=begin programlisting

    my @chars = 'a' .. 'z';
    my @count = 13 .. 27;

=end programlisting

X<qw()>
X<operators; qw()>
X<qw() operator>

... and you may use the C<qw()> operator to split a literal string on
whitespace to produce a list of strings:

=begin programlisting

    my @stooges = qw( Larry Curly Moe Shemp Joey Kenny );

=end programlisting

=begin sidebar

Perl will produce a warning if the literal string contains a comma or the
comment character.

=end sidebar
