=head2 Object Oriented Perl 5

Z<moose>

Perl 5 has an object system, though it's minimal.  It's very flexible--you can
build almost any other object system you want on top of it--but it provides
little assistance for performing the most common tasks simply and easily.

X<moose>

Moose is a more complete object system for Perl 5.  It builds on the existing
Perl 5 system but provides simpler defaults, better integration, and advanced
features from several other languages, including Smalltalk, Common Lisp, and
Perl 6.  It's still worth learning the default Perl 5 object system, if only to
write very simple programs where Moose is inappropriate or to maintain legacy
code, but Moose is currently the best way to write object-oriented code in Perl
5 today.

X<object orientation>
X<object oriented programming>
X<OO>
X<OOP>
X<objects>
X<classes>

I<Object orientation>, or I<object oriented programming>, is a way of managing
programs by categorizing their components into discrete, unique entities.
These are I<objects>.  In Moose terms, each object is an instance of a
I<class>, which serves as a template to describe any data the object contains
as well as its specific behaviors.

This is all well and good and accurate, but theoretical.  In practice, object
orientation is a way of classifying data and behaviors which operate on that
data.

=head3 Classes

X<classes>
X<package>

A Moose class uses a package as its name; this provides a namespace which
identifies the class uniquely and provides a place to store specific behaviors.
Declare a class with:

=begin programlisting

    {
        package Cat;

        use Moose;
    }

=end programlisting

=for author

Classes can be anonymous, but that is an advanced feature.  See C<perldoc
Moose::Meta::Class>.

=end for

=for author

Handwavy.

=end for

X<instance>
X<OO; instances>

This C<Cat> class doesn't do anything, but Moose does all of the work of
defining the class and making it work with the rest of Moose.  With all of this
done, you can create objects (or I<instances> of the C<Cat> class):

=begin programlisting

    my $brad = Cat->new();
    my $jack = Cat->new();

=end programlisting

The arrow syntax should look familiar; it's the same idea as dereferencing a
reference.  In this case, it performs a method call.

=head3 Methods

X<method>
X<invocant>
X<dispatch>
X<method dispatch>

A I<method> is a function associated with a class.  It resembles a
fully-qualified function call in a superficial sense, but it differs in two
important ways.  First, a method call always has an I<invocant>.  Second, a
method call always involves a I<dispatch> strategy.  In the case of creating
the two C<Cat> objects, the name of the class (C<Cat>) is the invocant:

=begin programlisting

    my $fuzzy = B<Cat>->new();

=end programlisting

The dispatch strategy describes how the object system decides I<which> method
to call.  This may seem obvious now, but object systems get much more powerful
(and somewhat more complex) when dispatch is less obvious.

A method in Moose (and Perl 5) is a function associated with a class which
expects its invocant as the first argument.  For example, the C<Cat> class
could have a C<meow()> method:

=begin programlisting

    {
        package Cat;

        use Moose;

        B<sub meow>
        B<{>
            B<my $self = shift;>
            B<say 'Meow!';>
        B<}>
    }

=end programlisting

Now all C<Cat> instances can wake you up in the morning because they haven't
eaten yet:

=begin programlisting

    my $alarm = Cat->new();
    $alarm->meow();
    $alarm->meow();
    $alarm->meow();

=end programlisting

X<class method>
X<methods; class>

By convention, invocants in Perl methods are lexical variables named C<$self>,
but this is merely pervasive convention.  You may have noticed that C<$self>
goes unused in this implementation of C<meow()>, so the actual invocant itself
is irrelevant once dispatch has found this method.  Like C<new()> (itself a
method), you may invoke C<meow()> with the name of the class as an invocant.
This is a I<class method>:

=begin programlisting

    Cat->meow() for 1 .. 3;

=end programlisting

The default constructor (C<new()>) is also a class method.

=head3 Attributes

X<attributes (objects)>
X<objects; attributes>
X<instance data>
X<state>
X<objects; state>

Every object in Perl 5 is unique.  That's not obvious from the features
discussed so far, which demonstrate no I<apparent> advantages from using
objects and their methods instead of class methods.  Fortunately, objects can
contain I<attributes>, or private data associated with each object.  You may
also hear this described as I<instance data> or I<state>.

X<attributes; typed>
X<attributes; ro>
X<attributes; read only>

To define object attributes, describe them as part of the class:

=begin programlisting

    {
        package Cat;

        use Moose;

        B<< has 'name', is => 'ro', isa => 'Str'; >>
    }

=end programlisting

In English, that line of code means "C<Cat> objects have a C<name> attribute.
It's readable but not writeable, and it's a string."  That single line of code
creates an accessor method (C<name()>) and allows you to pass a C<name>
parameter to the constructor:

=begin programlisting

    use Cat;

    for my $name (qw( Tuxie Petunia Daisy ))
    {
        my $cat = Cat->new( name => $name );
        say "Created a cat for ", $cat->name();
    }

=end programlisting

X<attributes; untyped>

Attributes do not I<need> to have types, in which case Moose will skip all of
the verification and validation for you:

=begin programlisting

    {
        package Cat;

        use Moose;

        has 'name', is => 'ro', isa => 'Str';
        B<< has 'age',  is => 'ro';>>
    }

    my $invalid = Cat->new( name => 'bizarre', age => 'purple' );

=end programlisting

This can be more flexible, but it can also lead to strange errors if someone
tries to provide invalid data for an attribute.

X<attributes; rw>
X<attributes; read-write>

If you mark an attribute as readable I<and> writable (with C<< is => rw >>),
Moose will create a mutator method you can use to change the value of that
attribute:

=begin programlisting

    {
        package Cat;

        use Moose;

        has 'name', is => 'ro', isa => 'Str';
        has 'age',  is => 'ro', isa => 'Int';
        B<< has 'diet', is => 'rw'; >>
    }

    my $fat = Cat->new( name => 'Fatty', age => 8, diet => 'Sea Treats' );
    say $fat->name(), ' eats ', $fat->diet();

    B<< $fat->diet( 'Low Sodium Kitty Lo Mein' ); >>
    say $fat->name(), ' now eats ', $fat->diet();

=end programlisting

Trying to use a C<ro> accessor as a mutator will throw an exception:

=begin screen

Cannot assign a value to a read-only accessor at ....

=end screen

=begin sidebar

When should you use C<ro> and when C<rw>?  It's a matter of design,
convenience, and purity.  One school of thought suggests making all instance
data C<ro> and passing all relevant data into the constructor.  In the C<Cat>
example, C<age()> might still be an accessor, but the constructor could take
the I<year> of the cat's birth and calculate the age itself based on the
current year, rather than relying on someone to update the age of all cats
manually.

This approach helps to consolidate any and all validation code in the same
place and helps to ensure that all created objects have valid data.  These are
design goals worth considering, though Moose does not enforce any particular
philosophy in this area.

=end sidebar

Now that individual objects can have their own instance data, the value of
object orientation may be more obvious.  An object is a bookmark of a sort for
the data it contains as well as the behavior appropriate to that data.  Think
of an object as a collection of named data and behaviors.  A class is the
description of the data and behaviors that instances of that class possess.

=head3 Encapsulation

X<encapsulation>

Moose allows you to declare I<which> attributes class instances possess as well
as how to treat those attributes.  The examples shown so far do not describe
I<how> to store those instances.  This information is available if you really
need it, but the declarative approach can actually improve your programs.  In
this way, Moose recommends the use of I<encapsulation>, or hiding the internal
details of an object from external uses of that object.

Consider a change to the age of a C<Cat>; instead of requesting that directly
from the constructor, calculate the age of a C<Cat> based on the year of its
birth:

=begin programlisting

    package Cat;

    use Moose;

    has 'name',        is => 'ro', isa => 'Str';
    has 'diet',        is => 'rw';
    B<< has 'birth_year',  is => 'ro', isa => 'Int'; >>

    B<sub age>
    B<{>
        B<my $self = shift;>
        B<my $year = (localtime)[5] + 1900;>

        B<return $year - $self->birth_year();>
    B<}>

=end programlisting

While the syntax for I<creating> C<Cat> objects has changed, the syntax for
I<using> C<Cat> objects has not.  The C<age()> method does the same thing it
has always done, at least as far as all code outside of the C<Cat> class
understands.  I<How> it does that has changed, but that is a detail internal to
the C<Cat> class--encapsulated within that class itself.

=begin sidebar

The old syntax for I<creating> C<Cat> objects could remain in place; customize
the generated C<Cat> constructor to allow passing an C<age> parameter and
calculate C<birth_year> appropriately from that.  See C<perldoc
Moose::Manual::Attributes>.

=end sidebar

X<attributes; default values>

This new approach to calculating C<Cat> ages has another advantage; you can use
I<default attribute values> to reduce the code necessary to create a C<Cat>
object:

=begin programlisting

    package Cat;

    use Moose;

    has 'name',        is => 'ro', isa => 'Str';
    has 'diet',        is => 'rw', isa => 'Str';
    B<< has 'birth_year',  is => 'ro', isa => 'Int', >>
                       B<< default => (localtime)[5] + 1900; >>

=end programlisting

The C<default> keyword on an attribute takes a single scalar value to use as
the default value for that attribute when constructing a new object.  If the
constructor does not receive an appropriate value for that attribute, the
object gets that default value instead.  Now you can create a kitten:

=begin programlisting

    my $kitten = Cat->new( name => 'Bitey' );

=end programlisting

... and that kitten will have an age of C<0> until next year.

=head4 Polymorphism

A program which deals with one type of data and one type of behavior on that
data benefits little from the use of objects.  A well-designed object-oriented
program should be capable of managing the details of many types of data and
many types of behavior for those types of data.  If designing classes helps
encapsulate specific details of objects into a single place (and, if done well,
this happens), then a curious thing happens for the rest of the program: it has
the opportunity to become I<less> specific.

In other words, moving the specifics of the details of what the program knows
about individual C<Cat>s (the attributes) and what the program knows that
C<Cat>s can do (the methods) into the C<Cat> class means that code that deals
with C<Cat> instances doesn't have to worry about those details in as much
detail as the C<Cat> class itself does.

This is clearer with an example.  Consider this function, which takes an object
and describes it:

=begin programlisting

    sub show_vital_stats
    {
        my $object = shift;

        say 'My name is ', $object->name();
        say 'I am ',       $object->age();
        say 'I eat ',      $object->diet();
    }

=end programlisting

X<polymorphism>

It's obvious (in context) that you can pass a C<Cat> object to this function
and get sane results.  It's less obvious that you can pass other types of
objects and get sane results.  This is an important object orientation property
called I<polymorphism>, where you can substitute an object of one class for an
object of another class if they provide the same external interface in the same
way.

X<genericity>

That is, any object of any class which provides the C<name()>, C<age()>, and
C<diet()> accessors will work with this function.  The function is sufficiently
generic that any object which respects this interface is a valid parameter.

=begin sidebar

X<duck typing>

Some languages and environments require a formal relationship between two
classes before allowing a program to substitute instances of one class for
another.  Perl 5 provides ways to enforce these checks, but it does not require
them.  Its default ad-hoc system lets you treat any two instances with methods
of the same name as equivalent enough.  Some people call this I<duck typing>.

=end sidebar

The benefit of the genericity in C<show_vital_stats()> is that the I<type> of
the object passed in doesn't matter, nor does its I<implementation>.  All that
matters is that it supports three methods, C<name()>, C<age()>, and C<diet()>
which take no arguments and each return something which can concatenate in a
string context.  Thus you may have a hundred different classes in your code,
none of which have any obvious relationshp between each other, but if they
conform to this expectation of behavior, they will work with this method.

This is an improvement over writing specific functions to extract and display
this information for even a fraction of those hundred classes.  Not only does
this genericity require you to write and to maintain less code, but using a
well-defined interface as the mechanism to access this information means that
any or all of those hundred classes can calculate that information any way they
like.  The details of those calculations is where it matters most: in the
bodies of the methods in the classes themselves.

Of course, the mere existence of a method called C<name()> or C<age()> does not
by itself imply the behavior of that object.  A C<Dog> object may have an
C<age()> which is an accessor and tells you that C<$rodney> is 8 but C<$lucky>
is 3.  A C<Cheese> object may have an C<age()> method that lets you determine
how long to stow C<$cheddar> so that it becomes sharp; in other words, C<age()>
may be an accessor in one class but not in another:

=begin programlisting

    # how old is the cat?
    my $years = $zeppie->age();

    # store the cheese in the warehouse for six months
    $cheese->age();

=end programlisting

Sometimes it's useful to know I<what> an object does.  In other words, you need to understand its type.

=head3 Roles

Z<roles>

A I<role> is a named collection of behavior and state.  A class is like a role,
with one important difference.  You can instantiate a class, but not a role.
The difference is important; while a class is primarily a mechanism for
organizing behaviors and state into a template for objects, a role is primarily
a mechanism for organizing behaviors and state into a named collection.

In short, a role is something a class does.

The difference between some sort of C<Animal>--with a C<name()>, an C<age()>,
and a preferred C<diet()>--and C<Cheese>--which can C<age()> in storage--may be
that the C<Animal> performs a C<LivingBeing> role, while the C<Cheese> performs
a C<Storable> role.

While you I<could> check that every object passed into C<show_vital_stats()> is
an instance of C<Animal>, you lose some genericity that way.  Instead, you
could check that the object I<performs> the C<LivingBeing> role.

The difference between those two is more apparent with an example.  First,
define the C<LivingBeing> role:

=begin programlisting

    {
        package LivingBeing;

        use Moose::Role;

        requires qw( name age diet );
    }

=end programlisting

In other words, anything which performs this rule must supply the C<name()>,
C<age()>, and C<diet()> methods.  This does not happen automatically; the
C<Cat> class must explicitly mark that it performs the role:

=begin programlisting

    package Cat;

    use Moose;

    has 'name',        is => 'ro', isa => 'Str';
    has 'diet',        is => 'rw', isa => 'Str';
    has 'birth_year',  is => 'ro', isa => 'Int',
                       default => (localtime)[5] + 1900;

    B<with 'LivingBeing';>

=end programlisting

=begin sidebar

The C<with> keyword used to apply roles to a class must occur I<after>
attribute declaration so that composition can identify any generated accessor
methods.

=end sidebar

X<roles; composition>

That single line has two functions.  First, it tells Moose to note that the
class (and instances of the class) perform this role.  Second, it composes the
role into the class.  This process checks that the class I<somehow> performs
all of the required methods and provides all of the required attributes and
ensures that no collisions are present.

The C<Cat> class provides C<name()> and C<diet()> methods as accessors to named
attributes.  It also declares its own C<age()> method.

Now all C<Cat> instances will return true when queried if they provide the
C<LivingBeing> role and C<Cheese> objects should not:

=begin programlisting

    say 'Alive!' if $fluffy->does('LivingBeing');
    say 'Moldy!' if $cheese->does('LivingBeing');

=end programlisting

This design approach may seem like extra bookkeeping, but it separates the
capabilities of classes and objects from the implementation of those classes
and objects.  The special behavior of the C<Cat> class, where it stores the
birth year of the animal and calculates the age directly, could itself be a
role:

=begin programlisting

    {
        package CalculateAgeFromBirthYear;

        has 'birth_year', is => 'ro', isa => 'Int',
                          default => (localtime)[5] + 1900;

        sub age
        {
            my $self = shift;
            my $year = (localtime)[5] + 1900;

            return $year - $self->birth_year();
        }
    }

=end programlisting

Moving this code out of the C<Cat> class into a separate role makes it
available to other classes which want to perform the
C<CalculateAgeFromBirthYear> role.  Now C<Cat> can perform both roles:

=begin programlisting

    package Cat;

    use Moose;

    has 'name', is => 'ro', isa => 'Str';
    has 'diet', is => 'rw';

    B<with 'LivingBeing', 'CalculateAgeFromBirthYear';>

=end programlisting

The implementation of the C<age()> method supplied by the
C<CalculateAgeFromBirthYear> satisfies the requirement of the C<LivingBeing>
role, and the composition succeeds.  Note that checking that objects perform
the C<LivingBeing> role remains unchanged, regardless of I<how> objects perform
this role or the source of attribute or method definitions.  A class could
choose to provide its own C<age()> method or obtain it from another role; that
doesn't matter.  All that matters is that it contains one.
