differences between packages and modules
    - packaging
    - installability
    - automated testing
    - dependencies tracked

why reuse the CPAN infrastructure?
    - good tools
    - automation
    - reporting
    - dependency tracking
    - consistent installation paths

local CPAN repository?
    - too advanced?  Nice to discuss, if there's space
