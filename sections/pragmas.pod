L<modules>.

callout to lexical scoping
    - static, compile-time effects
    - visibility just like that of C<my> declarations

using pragmas
    - C<strict> is a good example, C<integer>, C<utf8>
    - C<use>
    - C<no>
    - no simple rule of thumb on what I<makes> a pragma
    - loose convention, somewhat enforced by naming
    - generally it's the static scope....

useful pragmas
    - strict
    - warnings
    - utf8
    - autodie
    - mro
    - perl5i
    - constant
    - vars

writing lexically scoped pragmas
    - too advanced?
    - see perlpragma
    - good uses
