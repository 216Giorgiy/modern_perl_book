Z<barewords>

=for author

good uses of bare words
    - hash keys (usually)
    - built-in operators (I know it doesn't count, but...)
    - well-defined interfaces with prototyped subs
    - constants (sometimes)
    - special subroutines (BEGIN, DESTROY, AUTOLOAD....)
    - package names (when distinguished)

poor uses of bare words
    - filehandles
    - method names
    - subroutines in general
    - hash assignment pairs
    - sort subroutines
