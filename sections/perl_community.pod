=head2 The Perl Community

Z<perl_community>

One of the goals of Perl 5.000 was to encourage Perl development outside the
core of the language itself.  Where there were several forks of Perl 4 to talk
to various relational databases (sybperl to connect to Sybase, oraperl to talk
to Oracle, et cetera), Larry wanted people to be able to customize their own
dialects of Perl locally, without forking the language into thousands of
incompatible pidgins.

Encouraging customization -- while ensuring some degree of compatibility -- in
a culture that already supports sharing of knowledge and code is a great way to
build a community.

You don't have to join an "official" Perl community (as if such a thing
existed), but the Perl community exists in many forms in many places.  Consider
taking advantage of the knowledge and experience to help you solve your
problems and make the Perl ecosystem a little better.

=head3 Community Sites

X<perl.org>
X<websites; perl.org>

The main domain for Perl is U<http://www.perl.org/>.  This site hosts many
forums for communication as well as web sites dedicated to improving the world
of Perl.  Many of the best mailing lists have their hosting on perl.org.  See
U<lists.perl.org> for a list.  In particular, the Perl beginners mailing list
is a friendly place to ask novice questions and get accurate and helpful
answers from friendly people.  See U<http://beginners.perl.org/>.

perl.org also provides hosting for several important projects in the Perl
world.  One of the most important is U<http://dev.perl.org/>, a central site
for core development of Perl 5, Perl 6, and even Perl 1.

X<cpan.org>
X<websites; cpan.org>

The CPAN's central location is U<http://www.cpan.org/>.  Though
U<http://search.cpan.org/> is likely a more popular starting location, the
central software distribution hub of reusable, free Perl code is an essential
part of the Perl community.  See L<CPAN> for more.

X<PAUSE>
X<CPAN; PAUSE>

Note that PAUSE, the service CPAN authors and maintainers use to manage their
distributions, is part of C<perl.org>.

X<PerlMonks>

=for author

Should change the tense of "to celebrate" when appropriate.

=end for

PerlMonks, at U<http://perlmonks.org/>, is a venerable community site devoted
to questions and answers and other discussions about Perl programming.  It will
celebrate its tenth anniversary in December 2009, making it one of the oldest
web communities dedicated to any programming language.

Several community sites offer news and commentary.  The oldest is
U<http://use.perl.org/>; it has offered custom journals for many years.
Several well-known Perl hackers write there.

Other sites aggregate the Perl-related musings of Perl hackers, including
U<http://perlsphere.net/>, U<http://planet.perl.org/>, and
U<http://ironman.enlightenedperl.org/>.  The latter is part of an initiative
from the Enlightened Perl Organization (http://enlightenedperl.org/>) to
increase the amount of and improve the quality of Perl publishing on the web.

Perl Buzz (U<perlbuzz.com>) collects and republishes some of the most
interesting and useful Perl news on a regular basis.

=head3 Development Sites

Best Practical Consulting (U<http://bestpractical.com/>) maintains an
installation of their popular request tracking system, RT, for CPAN authors as
well as Perl 5 and Perl 6 development.  Every CPAN distribution has its own RT
queue, linked from C<search.cpan.org> and available on U<http://rt.cpan.org/>.
Perl 5 and Perl 6 have separate RT queues available on U<http://rt.perl.org/>.

The corehackers project helps identify useful changes to Perl 5 and helps to
mentor new developers into fixing bugs and adding features.  Its wiki is
available at U<http://corehackers.perl.org/>.

The Perl 5 Porters mailing list is the central point for Perl 5 development
discussion.  See U<http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=perl5-porters>.

The Perl Foundation (U<http://www.perlfoundation.org/>) hosts a wiki for all
things Perl 5.  See U<http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5>.

=head3 Events

X<YAPC>

There are plenty of events in the physical world as well.  The Perl community
holds a lot of conferences, workshops, and seminars.  In particular, the
community-held YAPC -- Yet Another Perl Conference -- is a successful, local,
low-cost conference model held on multiple continents.  See
U<http://yapc.org/>.

The Perl Foundation wiki lists other events at
U<http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?perl_events>.

X<Perl Mongers>

There are also hundreds of local Perl Mongers groups which get together
frequently for technical talks and social interaction.  See
U<http://www.pm.org/>.
